# Project Tables and Boards

While Issues are great for individual items, planning your work is crucial to working effectively. This means visualising of groups of issues, pull requests, or notes (also known as cards) in an interactive way that makes sense for your team.

Often, teams use external tools (including sticky notes on whiteboards) to track their work, or they'll fall back to simple spreadsheets. [Project Tables and Boards](https://github.com/features/issues) are GitHub's way of giving you visibilty over the work you care about.

Built like a spreadsheet, Project Tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. They're extremely customizable and you can tailor them to your needs with custom fields.

Project Boards give you a different view over the same data and behave more like kanban or sprint boards with columns for your items. You can customize what appears on each card, which field is used for the column, and apply any number of filters.

In a project, you can save views for sprints, backlogs, teams, or releases. You can rank, group, sort, and filter issues to suit the occasion, and you can choose between tables, boards, and soon a timeline view.

## Setting up Our Views

For our project, we're going to set up three views. One for all work in the repo, a sprint backlog, and finally a personal backlog.

### 👩‍💻 (Guided) Exercise 1

[▶️ Create a project](exercise-1.md)

In this exercise, we'll create a project for your repository and show how you can customize it and add your own custom fields.

_This is a guided exercise, so while you're welcome to jump ahead, you can also follow the proctor as they walk you through the process._

### 👩‍💻 Exercise 2

[▶️ Create a sprint board](exercise-2.md)

In this exercise, you'll create a new view for the current sprint.

### 👩‍💻 Exercise 3

[▶️ Create a personal backlog](exercise-2.md)

In this exercise, you'll create a new view for your personal work. While we'll make suggestions for how it should look, this is your view so customize it in a way that works for you!

## More features of Projects

There are a few features of projects we didn't get into:

### Workflows
There are a number of workflow automations you can currently enable for your project. These provide a way of linking activity on issues and pull requests to the status on your project boards.

At the moment, there are limited workflows you can enable, but soon you'll be able to specify your own.

Aside from these workflows, you can use GitHub Actions to automate working with projects. We'll look at this in more detail when we cover Actions.

### Insights
Insights for projects is currently in private beta. You can use insights to view and customize charts that use the items added to your project as their source data. The default "Burn up" chart shows item status over time, allowing you to visualize progress and spot patterns over time.
